	<h2 class="headers">A Brief History of Paris</h2>
	<p>Paris, France is a unique, charming city that draws visitors from around
	the world. The city is a focal point for many artists because it has
	superior art schools giving artists the opportunity to socialize 
	and learn from each other. By having the artists 
	travel there, Paris gained a lot of new art from the artists who 
	decided to live in the city.

	<p>Aside from art, Paris has a unique history as well. The city 
	is the site of the French Revolution where the monarchy
	was overthrown by the citizens. After the Reign of Terror, Napoleon 
	Bonaparte crowned himself emperor and rebuilt Paris.</p>
	<p>It is also worth traveling to Paris to visit the unique monuments. The 
	Eiffel Tower is a landmark designed for the 1889 World's Fair 
	in Paris. Originally many Parisians didn't want the Eiffel Tower to be 
	built because it didn't fit the architectural style of the rest of the 
	city. Over time the harsh criticism softened, making it one of the most
	visited <a id="attraction" href="attractions.html">attractions</a> in Paris.</p><br>

	<p>The Arc de Triomphe is another famous landmark that Napoleon 
	commissioned to show his strength. The statues around the outside of the 
	Arc de Triomphe depict Napoleon's victorious battles.</p><br>

	<p>The Louvre used to be a fortress, but was eventually converted into an 
	art museum. Napoleon Bonaparte added art from his conquests around the 
	world to the collection in the Louvre. Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon 
	Bonaparte's nephew, did not live in the Louvre, but he was emperor at the time of the expansion of the building, which included the  
	Napoleon III Apartments in the Richelieu wing. The apartments became the residence of the Minister of State.</p><br>
